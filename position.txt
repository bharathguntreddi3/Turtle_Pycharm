/*-Turtle position-*/

-- The turtle position is specified with the 2d co-ordination system

-- b = turtle.Turtle()

-- Change direction of the turtle by -

				[ b.setheading(degree) ] # any direction can be mention

-- Moving the turtle forward by -
				[ b.forward(any_pixel_value) ]   #argument can be int or float

-- Moving the turtle forward by -
				[ b.backward(any_pixel_value) ]   #argument can be int or float

-- Turning the turtle by -
				[ b.left(degree) ]  #turn the turtle to the assigned angle

-- [ b.hideturtle() ]  #hides the turtle
		- If you want to hide the turtle at last you try this at the end of your code
		- If you want to hide th turtle from the very begining you can place this at begining

-- [ b.speed(0-10) ]  #values form 0 to 10 o is the fastest and comes the 10

-- b.begin_fill()

-- b.end_fill()
